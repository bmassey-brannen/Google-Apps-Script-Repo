// you can create functions that run other functions in your repo
// it is important to call out that these run in the order they are listed below
// can be useful when you need to do multiple things because you can trigger function_All to run in your editor and not have to worry about setting up multiple triggers

function function_All(){
  function_1();
  function_2();
}
